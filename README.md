# Basic-Network-Sniffer
The Basic Network Sniffer is a Python tool built using Scapy to capture and analyze real-time network traffic. It monitors IP addresses, ports, protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP), packet size, and payload data. The tool displays live statistics and can export captured packets to CSV for learning and basic network security analysis.
